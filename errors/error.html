<h1>An Error has Occurred</h1>

<p>Based on the Error Message obtained by the Server, it appears to be your fault.</p>

<h2>Double Check your Queue Syntax!</h2>
<p>For reference, the new desired endpoint is <span class="code">/queue/sm64,sm64memes</span>, the other endpoint is considered deprecated.</p>
<p>Everything else (such as category and user filters along with orderby) is still done with arguments.</p>
<p>Example: <span class="code">/queue/sm64,sm64memes?category=70_Star&orderby=submitted</span>.</p>

<h2>Make sure the Endpoint actually exists!</h2>
<p>The only valid endpoints for this server are <span class="code">/data/</span> and <span class="code">/queue/</span>.</p>
<p>If you are unsure how the requests are supposed to be formatted, go to the main page.</p>
